# Dissecting Recycling Dynamics: A Two-Way ANOVA Analysis of Trends in Minnesotaâ€™s County-Level Waste Management from 1991 to 2017


## Project Overview
This project investigates recycling trends in Minnesota's counties over a span of 26 years (1991-2017) using a dataset named waste1data. By leveraging a two-way ANOVA, we aim to understand the dynamics of recycling behaviors based on different sources and material categories. The dataset comprises 49,019 entries from 86 counties, covering five key variables: Year, County, Category, Res Tons (Residential Tons), and CII Tons (Commercial/Institutional/Industrial Tons).
